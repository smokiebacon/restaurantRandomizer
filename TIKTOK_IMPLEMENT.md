Integration Guide
Implement the front-end code
Get started by connecting your front-end login button to the server endpoint. The following is an example in HTML:

<a href='{SERVER_ENDPOINT_OAUTH}'>Continue with TikTok</a>
Implement the server code to handle authorization grant flow
The server code must be responsible for the following:

Ensuring that the client secret and refresh token are stored securely.
Ensuring that the security for each user is protected by preventing request forgery attacks.
Handling the refresh flow before access token expiry.
Managing the access token request flow for each user.
Redirect request to TikTok's authorization server
Create an anti-forgery state token
You must prevent request forgery attacks to protect the security of your users. The first step before making the redirect request to TikTok's authorization server is to create a unique session token to maintain the state between the request and callback.

You will later match this unique session token with the authentication response to verify that the user is making the request and is not a malicious attacker.

One of the simple approaches to a state token is a randomly generated alphanumeric string constructed using a random-number generator, like the following example.

let array = new Uint8Array(30);
const csrfState = window.crypto.getRandomValues(array);
Generate a code verifier and code challenge
TikTok requires the Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) protocol for desktop apps to make the authorization flow more secure. You are required to generate a code verifier and code challenge pair for desktop authorization. Please note the following:

You should generate a new code verifier every time you initialize an authorization request.
You must use hex encoding of SHA256 to generate the code challenge from the code verifier.
Here's how to generate a code verifier and code challenge:

code*verifier
Generate a high-entropy cryptographic random string using the unreserved characters [A-Z] / [a-z] / [0-9] / "-" / "." / "*" / "~" , with a minimum length of 43 characters and a maximum length of 128 characters.

function generateRandomString(length) {
var result = '';
var characters = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789-.\_~';
var charactersLength = characters.length;
for (var i = 0; i < length; i++) {
result += characters.charAt(Math.floor(Math.random() \* charactersLength));
}
return result;
}
code_challenge
Create the code challenge by hashing the code verifier using hex encoding of SHA256. Since we only support S256 as code_challenge_method, use code_challenge = SHA256(code_verifier).

<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/crypto-js/3.1.9-1/crypto-js.min.js"></script>

// CryptoJS required
code_challenge = CryptoJS.SHA256(code_verifier).toString(CryptoJS.enc.Hex);
Initial redirect to TikTok's authorization page
To make the initial redirect request to TikTok's authorization server, the following query parameters below must be added to the Authorization Page URL using the application/x-www-form-urlencoded format.

For example, you can use an online URL encoder to encode parameters. Select UTF-8 as the destination character set.

Parameter

Type

Description

client_key

string

The unique identification key provisioned to the partner

scope

string

A comma (,) separated string of authorization scope(s). These scope(s) are assigned to your application on the TikTok for Developers website. They handle what content your application can and cannot access. If a scope is toggleable, the user can deny access to one scope while granting access to others.

redirect_uri

string

The redirect URI that you requested for your application. It must match one of the redirect URIs you registered for the app.

state

string

The state is used to maintain the state of your request and callback. This value will be included when redirecting the user back to the client. Check if the state returned in the callback matches what you sent earlier to prevent cross-site request forgery.

The state can also include customized parameters that you want TikTok service to return.

response_type

string

This value should always be set to code

code_challenge

string

SHA256 hash of code_verifier that will be used as a server-side challenge during authorization code exchange

code_challenge_method

string

This value should always be set to S256

Redirect your users to the authorization page URL and supply the necessary query parameters. Note that the page can only be accessed through HTTPS.

Type

Description

URL

https://www.tiktok.com/v2/auth/authorize/

Query parameters

client_key=<client_key>&response_type=code&scope=<scope>&redirect_uri=<redirect_uri>&state=<state>&code_challenge=<code_challenge>&code_challenge_method=S256

The following is an example using Node, Express, and JavaScript:

const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const fetch = require('node-fetch');
const cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');
const cors = require('cors');

app.use(cookieParser());
app.use(cors());
app.listen(process.env.PORT || 5000).

const CLIENT_KEY = 'your_client_key' // this value can be found in app's developer portal
const SERVER_ENDPOINT_REDIRECT = 'your_redirect_uri' // redirect URI should be registered in developer portal
const CODE_VERIFIER = 'your_unique_code_verifier'
const CODE_CHALLENGE = 'SHA256_hash_of_code_verifier'

app.get('/oauth', (req, res) => {
const csrfState = Math.random().toString(36).substring(2);
res.cookie('csrfState', csrfState, { maxAge: 60000 });

    let url = 'https://www.tiktok.com/v2/auth/authorize/';

    // the following params need to be in `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` format.
    url += '?client_key={CLIENT_KEY}';
    url += '&scope=user.info.basic';
    url += '&response_type=code';
    url += '&redirect_uri={SERVER_ENDPOINT_REDIRECT}';
    url += '&state=' + csrfState;
    url += '&code_challenge={CODE_VERIFIER}';
    url += '&code_challenge_method=S256'

    res.redirect(url);

})
TikTok prompts a users to log in or sign up
The authorization page takes the user to the TikTok website if the user is not logged in. They are then prompted to log in or sign up for TikTok.

TikTok prompts a user for consent
After logging in or signing up, an authorization page asks the user for consent to allow your application to access your requested permissions.

Manage authorization response
If the user authorizes access, they will be redirected to redirect_uri with the following query parameters appended using application/x-www-form-urlencoded format:

Parameter

Type

Description

code

string

Authorization code that is used in getting an access token

scopes

string

A comma-separated (,) string of authorization scope(s), which the user has granted

state

string

A unique, non-guessable string when making the initial authorization request. This value allows you to prevent CSRF attacks by confirming that the value coming from the response matches the one you sent.

error

string

If this field is set, the current user is not eligible for using third-party login or authorization. The partner is responsible for handling the error gracefully.

error_description

string

If this field is set, it will be a human-readable description about the error

Manage access token
Using the code appended to your redirect_uri, you can obtain access_token for the user, which completes the flow for logging in with TikTok.
